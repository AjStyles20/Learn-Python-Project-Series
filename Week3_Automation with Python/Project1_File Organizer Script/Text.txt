                        Problem Statement
Create a Python script that automatically organizes files in a folder by file type — putting images, docs, videos, etc., into separate subfolders.

                        What You'll Learn

- File system navigation (using os)  
- Moving files with shutil  
- Handling file extensions  
- Automating daily productivity tasks

                        What It Does

1. Scans your folder for files  
2. Checks each file’s extension  
3. Moves them to a matching subfolder (auto-created)

                        Try Modifying

- Add logging for moved files  
- Schedule it with Task Scheduler / Cron  
- Add GUI with Tkinter
